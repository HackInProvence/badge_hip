"""
Try to calibrate the CC1101 crystal using the serial port.
The radio_calibrate program must be flashed on the device.
Requires pyserial.

Conclusions:
- the pico time is accurate (at least it does not deviate from my laptop clock),
- when connecting to the serial to read the frequency, it slows down;
  this may be caused by the UART that may have a higher priority interrupt than our GPIO counter
  -> we should use core 1 to count!
- we can read the most precise value by flashing the radio_calibrate.uf2, rebooting the pico,
  waiting (> 10s ?), then connecting with UART (once connected, even if disconnected, the value drifts).
