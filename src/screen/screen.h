/** \file screen.h
 *
 * \brief Screen API: display images, interface, ...
 *
 * The e-Paper screen is controlled by SPI.
 * It works with a 2MHz connection and images are 200*200 with 2 bit planes.
 * Each plane is packed to 8 pixels per byte, so each plane is 5000 bytes.
 * Transferring 2 planes takes around 5ms.
 * This means that it should be fast enough to use \ref spi_*_blocking functions.
 *
 * However, we can't wait for an image to be completely rendered, as this takes around 1s.
 *
 * If image transfer is not quick enough, we can use DMA with SPI DREQ to transfer data to the screen.
 * However, be aware that the D/C pin must be low when pushing the first byte, then it must be kept high.
 *
 * Another note is that the MOSI/RX and MISO/TX pins are a single pin of the e-Paper device (DIN).
 * You have to put the RX pin to another GPIO function so that it does not short circuit the TX pin while reading.
 *
 * You can compile images using the image2epaper.py script.
