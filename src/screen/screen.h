 *
 * \brief Screen API: display images, interface, ...
 *
 * The e-Paper screen is controlled by SPI.
 * It works with a 2MHz connection and images are 200*200 with 2 bit planes.
 * Each plane is packed to 8 pixels per byte, so each plane is 5000 bytes.
 * Transferring 2 planes takes around 5ms.
 * This means that it should be fast enough to use \ref spi_*_blocking functions.
 *
 * However, we can't wait for an image to be completely rendered, as this takes around 1s.
 *
 * If image transfer is not quick enough, we can use DMA with SPI DREQ to transfer data to the screen.
 * However, be aware that the D/C pin must be low when pushing the first byte, then it must be kept high.
 *
 * Another note is that the MOSI/RX and MISO/TX pins are a single pin of the e-Paper device (DIN).
 * You have to put the RX pin to another GPIO function so that it does not short circuit the TX pin while reading.
 *
 * You can compile images using the image2epaper.py script.
 *
 * The usual use of this library is:
 * - screen_init(),
 * - call screen_boot() regularly until it returns true (~15ms),
 * - now you can push an image:
 *   - set the image position with screen_set_image_position(),
 *   - use one of the screen_show_image_* functions,
 *   - or manually screen_set_ws() to load some waveform settings to choose your color mode and refresh style
 *     (black and white, or 4 grays, partial/full refresh, ...),
 *     then screen_push_rams() to load the image in the RAM banks,
 *     then screen_show_rams() to actually show your image,
 *   - wait for screen_busy() to go low (~1s)
 * - either push another image
 * - or go screen_deep_sleep() -> call screen_boot() to reset and push other images.
 *
 * NOTE: the datasheet recommends to deep sleep as soon as possible,
 *  and to screen_clear() before going for longer sleeps (days),
 *  and to not refresh the screen too much (> 3 minutes between refreshes (!!!)).
 *
 * TODO:
 * - text -> probably too complex, we will send pre-rendered images,
 * - have a ws that uses the RED ram as a mask to NOT update some pixels (overlay),
 * - try to have more gray levels (uses the DONTOUCH mask).
 * - have a ws that refresh a zone of the RAM (uses the RED mask to not touch the rest), so that a previous black can be canceled,
 *   then push the new image for that zone and draw it quicker/without traces
 * */
